# 🌐 Portfolio

This is the updated version of my personal portfolio website, built using a full-stack approach with **React**, **CSS**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. The site is designed to showcase my work, skills, and provide a way for visitors to connect with me.

SOME SCREEN SIZES CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED INCLUDING:

- Skills tiles strecthing to fill screen on Ipad Mini and Pro, Surface Pro 7, Asus Zenbook Fold (Portrait Mode)
- Header broken on Surface Duo
- Contents squished on Nest Hub

Will be fixing this in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience. If any other screen sizes look wonky please let me know.
