# 🌐 Portfolio

This is the updated version of my personal portfolio website, built using a full-stack approach with **React**, **CSS**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. The site is designed to showcase my work, skills, and provide a way for visitors to connect with me.

## ✨ Overview

This project is a modern, responsive, and performance-focused web portfolio. It emphasizes clean UI, accessibility, and maintainable code. It also includes a backend powered by Node.js and PostgreSQL for dynamic features like contact form submissions and (optionally) content management.

### Frontend
- **React** – component-based UI
- **CSS** – styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – scripting and interactivity

### Backend

1. Global / Foundation

 Switch to a clean, modern font (e.g., Inter or Geist via Google Fonts).

 Update color palette (ditch harsh yellow on blue → use softer accent).

 Add consistent spacing (8px scale, more whitespace around sections).

 Consider gradient or subtle pattern for the background instead of flat blue.

2. Navigation Bar

 Make it sticky at the top.

 Add backdrop blur + slight transparency.

 Modern hover underline animation for links.

3. Hero Section

 Larger, bolder heading (36–48px).

 Subheading/body with softer gray text.

 Better vertical alignment (photo + intro side by side, centered).

4. Contact Card

 Change gray background → glassmorphic or soft dark card.

 Add your photo in a circle at top.

 Modernize the button (pill shape, gradient, hover shadow).

 Adjust text hierarchy (name larger, roles lighter).

 Social icons: add subtle hover effects.

5. Skills Section

 Replace flat gray squares with uniform modern cards (rounded corners, soft border, hover lift).

 Add labels under icons (smaller text).

 Use responsive grid with equal spacing.

6. About Section

 Headline styling consistent with “Skills” (uppercase, muted accent color).

 Improve text readability (larger, softer color, more line spacing).

7. Footer

 Center the text.

 Muted color instead of black.

 Styled links with hover underline.
